## ⚙ Introduction to API

In the world of software development, an API (Application Programming Interface) plays a crucial role in enabling different applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allow developers to build software that can leverage the functionalities of other services, libraries, or systems.

For more understanding about APIs, make sure to check out [Intro-to-API](./Intro-to-API.md).
